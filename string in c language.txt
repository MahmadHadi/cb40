what is string?
    group of character are known as string. for example your name,surname,address,city

    in c language string is always end with null \0

    c language has no data type for string.

    to store string we have to create and use 1 dimensional array of character.

    example of how to create string 
    char name[32];

    how to take input in string 
    printf("Enter your name");
    scanf("%s",name); //must not give space in input else string will terminate by space. 

    how to display string 
    printf(" name = %s",name);

    char fullname[64];

    printf("Enter your fullname");
    gets(fullname); //gets function is used to accept strign with space.

    another way to print string 
    puts(fullname);

    //to use gets and puts function we need to include string.h header file in program.
